The GN gate was proposed in [1] and is made up of two Controlled-V gates, one Controlled-V$^\dagger$ gate, and one CNOT gate. This gate returns $A \oplus C$, $\overline{A}C \oplus B$, and $C$. This implementation have been optimised and can be seen in ![optimised version of the GN gate](GN_proposed.png)
