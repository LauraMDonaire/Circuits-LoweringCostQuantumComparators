The 2-bit half-comparator presented in [1] is made up of two R-Bcomps modules, two CNOT gates, and two TR gates. In the [original implementation of Thapliyal's comparator](Thapliyal_original.png), it can be observed the gates that form each module R-Bcomp, which are two TR gates and one CNOT gate. The relevant outputs of this circuit are Z and Y, Y becomes 1 when the condition $x>y$ is satisfied, and Z becomes 1 when $x < y$.
Therefore, using the new version of the [TR gate proposed](LoweringCostQuantumComparators/Gates/TRgate/TR_proposed.png), a [new optimised comparator circuit is proposed](Proposed_optimised_1.png).
